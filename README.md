# WebXR image tracking example

In this example I've forked the example by Klaus Weidner (https://arimg.glitch.me/)
and implemented a 360Â° portal for A-Frame.

This uses the new marker tracking feature in Chrome on Android.
Currently requires Chrome Canary 88.0.4313.2 or newer, and needs "WebXR Incubations" enabled in chrome://flags.

You can read more about this feature here: https://github.com/immersive-web/marker-tracking/blob/main/explainer.md

*WARNING: Experimental.* This is a preliminary API and is likely to change.
